In this work, we analyze clustering performance across three distinct datasets—Hepatitis, Mushroom, and Pen-based—using multiple clustering algorithms, including K-Means, Global K-Means, X-Means, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), and Spectral Clustering. Each algorithm was thoroughly evaluated using key hyperparameters, multiple distance metrics, and cluster validity indices such as ARI, NMI, DBI, Silhouette Score, and CHS. Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and UMAP were employed for visualization. The results provide comprehensive insights into the effects of algorithmic configurations, dataset characteristics, and computational efficiency. Notably, Global K-Means ensures robust consistency over K-Means, while FCM demonstrates superior adaptability in datasets with varying density and boundaries.
