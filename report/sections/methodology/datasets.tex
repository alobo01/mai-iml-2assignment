\subsection{Datasets}
A brief overview of the three datasets is presented below.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hepatitis.} It is a medical dataset aimed at predicting patient survival based on clinical and demographic features. 
    This dataset is characterized by its imbalance, as it involves a higher number of survivors compared to non-survivors. It 
    is primarily used for binary classification tasks, where the objective is to determine survival outcomes. The features in 
    this dataset are diverse, including both numerical and categorical attributes
    \item \textbf{Mushroom.} It is designed to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on their physical 
    characteristics. It is a balanced dataset, that comprises 23 categorical features, which capture various traits such as gill spacing, cap shape, and odor. 
    These features are primarily ordinal and nominal, requiring appropriate encoding before applying machine learning models.
    \item \textbf{Pen-based.} It is a large numerical dataset designed for multiclass classification tasks, specifically recognizing handwritten 
    digits from 0 to 9. Each instance is represented by 16 numerical features derived from pen-tip trajectories on a 2D grid,
    with values ranging from -1 to 1. It had no missing values.
\end{itemize}
